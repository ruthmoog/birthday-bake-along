    <section class="icing">
        <h2>Italian Meringue Buttercream</h2>
        <p>The cake needs time to cool before icing, so we won't decorate the cake on the call.
            If you want to make your own icing, I am going to use this recipe at home. (You'll need a freestanding mixer or a lot of arm power).</p>
        <section class="ice-ingredients">
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1¾ cups caster sugar</li>
            <li>8 large egg whites, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 cups unsalted butter, cut into tablespoon-sized pieces, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="ice-directions">
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and half a cup of water.  Place over medium heat and bring to a boil.  Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pan.</li>
            <li>While the sugar syrup is heating, put the egg whites in a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.</li>
            <li>When the syrup reaches 230°F|110°C begin to whip the egg whites on medium-high speed.  Whip until the egg whites are stiff.</li>
            <li>When the syrup reaches 240°F|115°C, immediately remove the pan from the heat and, with the mixer running, pour the syrup into the egg whites in a very thin stream avoiding the whisk.</li>
            <li>Whip the meringue at high speed until thick and glossy and the bowl is no longer warm on the outside, about 8-12 mins.</li>
            <li>With the mixer running, add the butter a piece at a time, whipping until each piece is fully incorporated before adding the next. Scrape the sides down every now and then.</li>
            <li>After all the butter has been added, continue to whip until it's thick and smooth, 3-5 minutes.  Beat in the vanilla.</li>
            <li>Use immediately, or transfer into an airtight container for up to 1 week in the fridge or up to 2 months in the freezer. Let it warm up to room temperature before using and stir to smooth it out.</li>
        </ol>
